## Overview

TodoApp DevOps Automation is a full CI/CD setup for a simple Todo application. It automates the code build, test, and deployment processes, making development more efficient and error-free.

## Technologies Used

- **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS EC2** for deployment
- **GitHub** for version control
- **Shell Scripts** for automation tasks

## Features

- Automated code building, testing, and deployment
- Dockerized application for consistent environments
- Cloud deployment on AWS EC2
- Integration with Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Jenkins** installed and configured (or set up on an EC2 instance)
- **Docker** installed
- AWS account for EC2 instance deployment

1. **Clone the repository**
